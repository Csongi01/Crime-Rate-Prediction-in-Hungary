    "# **About PyCaret**\n",
    "\n",
    "[**PyCaret**](https://pycaret.org) is an open-source, low-code machine learning library in Python that automates machine learning workflows. It allows data scientists and analysts to perform end-to-end machine learning experiments with ease and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Key Features of PyCaret**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Low-Code:** PyCaret reduces the lines of code needed for typical machine learning tasks by providing a high-level API.\n",
    "2. **Ease of Use:** Designed for both beginners and experts, it simplifies the machine learning process.\n",
    "3. **Speed:** Speeds up the experiment cycle by automating repetitive tasks.\n",
    "4. **Scalability:** Can be used for small datasets as well as large-scale deployments.\n",
    "5. **Interoperability:** Integrates seamlessly with other popular libraries such as scikit-learn, XGBoost, and LightGBM.\n",
    "6. **Modularity:** Offers a modular approach, allowing users to only use the parts of the library they need.\n"
